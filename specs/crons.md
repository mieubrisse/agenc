Crons
=====

Overview
--------

This spec describes **crons** — scheduled, headless missions that the daemon launches automatically on a crontab schedule. Crons enable autonomous background work: agents run on a schedule without user intervention, and the user can check results via `cron history` or by resuming completed missions.


Prerequisites
-------------

### Verify `--print` Resumability

Before implementing crons, verify that headless Claude sessions can be resumed:

```bash
claude --print -p "Say hello and remember the number 42"
claude -c -p "What number did I ask you to remember?"
```

If `-c` successfully continues the `--print` conversation, proceed with this spec. If not, investigate alternatives:

- `claude -p <prompt>` with stdin closed (may behave differently)
- A different flag combination
- Filing a feature request with Anthropic

**This is a blocker.** Do not implement crons until headless resumability is confirmed.


Crons

### Definition

A cron is a named, scheduled rule that tells the daemon to create and launch a headless mission at specific times. Each cron definition contains:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | yes | UUID that uniquely identifies this cron across time. Auto-generated by `cron new`. |
| `schedule` | yes | Standard 5-field crontab expression (`minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week`). |
| `agent` | yes | Agent template to use (canonical `github.com/owner/repo` format). |
| `prompt` | yes | The prompt text to pass to Claude. |
| `description` | no | Human-readable description of what this cron does. Displayed in `cron ls`. |
| `git` | no | A Git repo from the agenc repo library to copy into the mission's workspace. |
| `timeout` | no | Maximum runtime before the mission is killed. Format: `30m`, `2h`, `1h30m`. Default: `1h`. |
| `overlap` | no | Policy when previous run is still active: `skip` (default) or `allow`. |
| `enabled` | no | Boolean. Disabled crons are retained in config but do not fire. Default: `true`. |

### Timezone Behavior

All crontab expressions are evaluated against the **system's local time**. The daemon uses `time.Now()` truncated to the minute. Agenc does not support per-cron timezone configuration; if you need a cron to fire at a specific time in a different timezone, convert the schedule to local time.

### Storage

Cron definitions live in `config.yml` under a top-level `crons` key:

```yaml
crons:
  maxConcurrent: 5  # optional, default: 10

  daily-git-sync:
    id: "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"  # auto-generated by cron new
    description: "Check all repos for unpushed changes and report"
    schedule: "0 9 * * *"
    agent: github.com/mieubrisse/git-sync-agent
    prompt: "Check all repos for unpushed changes"
    timeout: 30m
    overlap: skip

  weekly-todoist-cleanup:
    id: "6ba7b810-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8"  # auto-generated by cron new
    description: "Organize Todoist inbox into projects"
    schedule: "0 10 * * 1"
    agent: github.com/mieubrisse/todoist-agent
    prompt: "Clear the Todoist inbox and organize tasks into appropriate projects"
    git: github.com/mieubrisse/todoist-config
    timeout: 1h
    overlap: skip
```

### Global Settings

The `crons` section supports one global setting:

- **`maxConcurrent`** — Maximum number of headless cron missions that can run simultaneously. Default: `10`. When the limit is reached, new cron fires are skipped (not queued) and a warning is logged.

### CLI Commands

Crons are managed through `agenc cron` subcommands:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `agenc cron new` | Interactive wizard: prompts for name, schedule, agent template (fzf picker), prompt, and optional fields. Validates inputs and writes to config.yml. |
| `agenc cron ls` | Lists all crons with name, schedule, agent, enabled, last run status, and next fire time. |
| `agenc cron rm <name>` | Removes a cron from config.yml. Does not affect missions already created by the cron. |
| `agenc cron enable <name>` | Sets `enabled: true` for the named cron. |
| `agenc cron disable <name>` | Sets `enabled: false` for the named cron. |
| `agenc cron run <name>` | Creates a headless mission using the cron's config (agent, prompt, timeout, git). Does NOT associate the mission with the cron — it's just a convenience for manual testing. |
| `agenc cron logs <name>` | Tails the `claude-output.log` of the most recent mission for this cron. Supports `--follow` flag. |
| `agenc cron history <name>` | Shows recent scheduled runs for this cron with timestamps and running/stopped status. |

### `cron ls` Output Format

```
NAME             SCHEDULE      ENABLED  LAST RUN              STATUS    NEXT RUN
daily-git-sync   0 9 * * *     yes      2025-01-15 09:00      stopped   2025-01-16 09:00
weekly-review    0 10 * * 1    yes      2025-01-13 10:00      stopped   2025-01-20 10:00
hourly-check     0 * * * *     yes      2025-01-15 14:00      running   2025-01-15 15:00
disabled-cron    0 6 * * *     no       2025-01-10 06:00      stopped   -
```

**Status** is determined by checking if the mission's PID is still running.

Use `--verbose` or `-v` to include description and agent columns.

### Crontab Parsing Library

Use [`adhocore/gronx`](https://github.com/adhocore/gronx) (v1.19.6+, MIT license) for crontab expression parsing and evaluation. Key API:

- `gronx.New().IsValid(expr)` — validate a cron expression.
- `gronx.New().IsDue(expr, referenceTime)` — check if an expression matches a specific time.
- `gronx.NextTickAfter(expr, refTime, false)` — find the next fire time after a reference.

### Validation

**On `cron new`:**
- Cron name must be non-empty and contain only `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]`.
- Cron name must be unique (not already defined in config).
- Schedule must be a valid 5-field crontab expression.
- Agent must exist in `agentTemplates` section of config.yml.
- Git repo (if specified) must exist in the `repoConfig` section of config.yml.
- Timeout must be a valid Go duration string (e.g., `30m`, `1h`, `2h30m`).
- Overlap must be one of: `skip`, `allow`.

**On daemon startup:**
- Log warnings for crons with invalid agent or git references (don't crash).
- Invalid crons are skipped during scheduling.

**On cron fire:**
- If agent template doesn't exist: skip, log error, record failed run.
- If git repo doesn't exist: skip, log error, record failed run.

### Daemon Scheduling

The daemon gains a new background goroutine: the **cron scheduler**.

**Cycle:** Every 60 seconds.

**Behavior:**

1. Read the `crons` section of `config.yml`.
2. Get the current time, truncated to the minute.
3. Count currently running headless missions (wrappers). If >= `maxConcurrent`, log a warning and skip this cycle.
4. For each enabled cron with valid references, evaluate the crontab expression using `IsDue(expr, now)`.
5. For each cron whose schedule matches:
   a. **Double-fire guard:** Check `missions` table. If a mission exists for this cron with `created_at` within the current minute, skip (already fired).
   b. **Overlap policy:**
      - `skip`: Check most recent mission for this cron. If its PID is still running, skip this fire and log it.
      - `allow`: Proceed regardless of running missions.
   c. **Concurrency check:** If running headless missions >= `maxConcurrent`, skip and log.
   d. **Spawn headless mission:** Fork `agenc mission new --headless --cron-id <id> --cron-name <name> --timeout <timeout> --agent <agent> --git <git> -p <prompt>`.
      The subprocess handles everything: mission creation (with cron metadata), Claude invocation, heartbeating, output capture, secrets, and timeout enforcement.
   e. **Track process:** Store subprocess PID and mission ID in daemon's in-memory map for cleanup.
6. **Completion handling:** When a wrapper process exits, the daemon removes it from the in-memory tracking map.

**Missed runs:** If the daemon was not running when a cron was scheduled to fire, the run is skipped. The daemon does not backfill missed runs. This matches standard cron behavior.

### Daemon Startup: Orphan Handling

On daemon startup, handle cron missions that may still be running from before the daemon restarted:

1. Query `missions` for rows where `cron_id IS NOT NULL`.
2. For each cron mission, check if the wrapper process is still running (read PID from mission's `pid` file, check if process exists).
3. If running: adopt the wrapper (add to in-memory tracking map for cleanup on shutdown).

### Daemon Shutdown

On `SIGTERM` or `SIGINT`:

1. Stop the cron scheduler loop.
2. For each running headless wrapper process:
   a. Send `SIGINT` to the wrapper. The wrapper will forward this to Claude and handle graceful shutdown.
   b. Wait up to 60 seconds for wrapper to exit (wrapper has its own 30-second grace period for Claude).
   c. If wrapper still running, send `SIGKILL`.
3. Exit.

Note: The wrapper process terminates, which is detectable via the PID file on next daemon startup or via `cron ls`.

### Headless Mode

The `agenc mission new` command gains two new flags for headless execution:

- **`--headless`** — Run without terminal interaction. Changes behavior as described below.
- **`--timeout <duration>`** — Maximum runtime before killing Claude (e.g., `30m`, `1h`). Only valid with `--headless`. Default: `1h`.

**Example (manual headless mission):**
```bash
agenc mission new --headless --timeout 30m -p "Check all repos for unpushed changes"
```

| Aspect | Interactive Mode | Headless Mode (`--headless`) |
|--------|------------------|------------------------------|
| Claude command | `claude <prompt>` or `claude -c` | `claude --print -p <prompt>` |
| stdin | Wired to user's terminal | `/dev/null` |
| stdout/stderr | Wired to user's terminal | Captured to `claude-output.log` |
| Spawned by | User (foreground) or daemon (background) | User or daemon |
| Template live-reload | Yes (fsnotify watches) | No (single-shot execution) |
| Timeout enforcement | No | Yes (kills Claude after timeout) |
| On completion | Wrapper exits, user returns to shell | Wrapper exits (status detectable via PID file) |

**Shared behavior (both modes):**
- Heartbeat updates every 30 seconds
- Secrets handling via `op run --env-file` if `secrets.env` exists
- Sets `AGENC_MISSION_UUID` environment variable
- Writes PID to mission's `pid` file

Headless missions reuse the same directory structure, DB record, and `AGENC_MISSION_UUID` as interactive missions. Users can `mission resume` a completed headless mission to continue interactively.

### Log Rotation

The wrapper (in headless mode) manages `claude-output.log` with size-based rotation:

- Maximum size: 10 MB
- On rotation: rename to `.1`, shift existing `.1` to `.2`, etc.
- Keep last 3 rotated files (`.1`, `.2`, `.3`)
- Rotation checked at mission start and periodically during execution

### Database Changes

**Add columns to missions table:**

```sql
ALTER TABLE missions ADD COLUMN cron_id TEXT;    -- UUID from cron definition, NULL if not cron-spawned
ALTER TABLE missions ADD COLUMN cron_name TEXT;  -- name snapshot at creation, NULL if not cron-spawned
```

**Add index for cron queries:**

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_missions_cron ON missions(cron_id, created_at DESC) WHERE cron_id IS NOT NULL;
```

**Status detection:** Use the existing `pid` file to determine if a mission is running (process exists) or stopped (process doesn't exist).

ALTER TABLE missions ADD COLUMN cron_id TEXT;    -- UUID from cron definition
ALTER TABLE missions ADD COLUMN cron_name TEXT;  -- name snapshot at creation

CREATE INDEX idx_missions_cron ON missions(cron_id, created_at DESC) WHERE cron_id IS NOT NULL;
```


Changes to Existing Components
------------------------------

### Daemon

- **New goroutine:** Cron scheduler (60-second cycle). Evaluates cron expressions and spawns `mission new --headless` subprocesses.
- **Process tracking:** Maintain in-memory map of running headless mission PIDs.
- **Orphan handling:** On startup, adopt running missions or mark orphaned runs.
- **Shutdown cleanup:** Send SIGINT to running missions, wait for graceful exit.
- **New command:** `agenc daemon status` to show running goroutines, last activity, and running headless missions.

### `agenc mission new`

- **New `--headless` flag:** Run without terminal interaction.
- **New `--timeout` flag:** Maximum runtime for headless missions (e.g., `30m`, `1h`). Only valid with `--headless`.
- Headless mode changes: Claude invoked with `--print`, stdout/stderr captured to `claude-output.log`, timeout enforcement, no template live-reload.

### Mission Wrapper

- **Headless support:** When `mission new --headless` is used, wrapper runs in headless mode.
- **Timeout enforcement (headless):** Kill Claude after configured timeout.
- **Output capture (headless):** Write stdout/stderr to `claude-output.log` with rotation.
- **Environment variable:** Set `AGENC_MISSION_UUID` (both modes).

### Mission Directory

```
$AGENC_DIRPATH/missions/<uuid>/
    pid
    claude-state
    template-commit
    wrapper.log
    claude-output.log      # headless only
    claude-output.log.1    # rotated
    claude-output.log.2
    claude-output.log.3
    agent/
        ...
```

### `agenc mission ls`

- Display cron name for cron-spawned missions.
- Add `--cron <name>` filter flag.


What Does NOT Change
--------------------

- Existing mission lifecycle (new, resume, archive, stop, rm, nuke).
- Mission wrapper state machine for interactive missions.
- Template updater daemon goroutine.
- The `agenc template` and `agenc repo` command families.
- Daemon's repo update loop behavior.


Implementation Phases
---------------------

**Phase 0: Prerequisite verification**

- Parse `crons` section from config.yml with validation.
- Implement `agenc cron new/ls/rm/enable/disable`.

**Phase 2: Headless mode**
- Add `--headless`, `--timeout`, `--cron-id`, and `--cron-name` flags to `mission new`.
- Implement output capture to `claude-output.log` with rotation.
- Implement timeout enforcement (SIGTERM → SIGKILL).
- Set `AGENC_MISSION_UUID` environment variable in wrapper.
- Test headless mode independently (`mission new --headless`) before integrating with daemon.

**Phase 3: Cron execution**

- Implement `agenc cron history <name>`.
- Implement `agenc daemon status`.
- Add `--cron` filter to `mission ls`.


Design Decisions
----------------

The following decisions were made during spec development:

### Notification of Cron Failures

**Decision:** Do nothing. Users check status manually via `cron ls` or `cron history`.

**Rationale:** Keeps the initial implementation simple. Notification mechanisms (auto-messaging, webhooks) can be added later if needed.

### Daemon Observability

**Decision:** Add `agenc daemon status` command.

**Rationale:** Provides useful debugging information (running goroutines, last activity, running headless missions) without overengineering. Structured logging and health endpoints can be added later if needed.

### Retention Policy

**Decision:** No retention policy for crons. Mission retention is handled separately.

**Rationale:** Decouples concerns. Cron definitions focus on scheduling; mission lifecycle management is a separate feature.

### Manual Cron Runs

**Decision:** `agenc cron run <name>` creates an untracked headless mission using the cron's config. It does NOT associate the mission with the cron.

**Rationale:** Keeps things simple. Manual runs are for testing — the user can see output in the terminal or check `claude-output.log`. They don't need to appear in `cron history`.

### Cron Identity

**Decision:** Each cron has a UUID (`id` field) that uniquely identifies it across time. Missions store both `cron_id` and `cron_name` (snapshot at creation).

**Rationale:** Follows the Kubernetes model where names are human-readable identifiers that can be reused after deletion, while UIDs provide unique identity across the cluster's lifetime. If a user deletes a cron and creates a new one with the same name, the new cron gets a new UUID, so run history remains correctly associated with the original cron. The name snapshot ensures `cron history` shows meaningful names even for deleted crons.

### No Separate `cron_runs` Table

**Decision:** Store cron metadata (`cron_id`, `cron_name`) on the `missions` table. Use PID file to determine running/stopped status.

**Rationale:** Simplifies the data model. A cron run *is* a mission — there's no meaningful distinction. We already have a mechanism (PID file) to detect if a mission is running. No need for `exit_code`, `exit_reason`, or `finished_at` columns.

### Messaging and Inbox

**Decision:** Deferred to a future spec.

**Rationale:** The initial cron implementation focuses on headless execution. Agent-to-user messaging and inbox can be designed separately once crons are working.
