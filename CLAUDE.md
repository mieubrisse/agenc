Agent Factory
=============

Architecture Reference
----------------------

Read `docs/system-architecture.md` before making non-trivial changes to the codebase. It is the canonical map of how the system fits together — runtime processes, directory layout, package responsibilities, and cross-cutting patterns.

**Keep it current.** When you make a change that affects any of the following, update `docs/system-architecture.md` in the same commit:

- Adding, removing, or renaming an `internal/` package
- Changing process boundaries (CLI, server, wrapper) or their goroutine structure
- Modifying the runtime directory layout under `$AGENC_DIRPATH`
- Altering the database schema
- Adding or changing a key architectural pattern (config merging, idle detection, cron scheduling, etc.)

The architecture doc describes the system at the **filepath level** — no code snippets, no function signatures. If you need to reference something more specific than a file path, that detail belongs in code comments, not in the architecture doc.

Adjutant
--------

"Adjutant" refers to the in-codebase assistant that helps users operate AgenC. It is implemented as Go code within the codebase — not an external service or separate binary.

When the user mentions "Adjutant" or you see references to it in code, understand that this is the built-in assistant component that provides guidance and helps users navigate AgenC functionality.

Tmux Keybindings and Command Palette
-------------------------------------

When the user refers to "tmux keybindings," they are talking about the tmux keybindings and command palette commands implemented in this codebase — not the general tmux application itself.

This refers to the command palette feature within AgenC that provides tmux-style keyboard shortcuts for executing commands and navigating the interface. All related code, configuration, and functionality exists within this repository.

Building and Checking
---------------------

Always build via the Makefile — never run `go build` directly. The Makefile injects the version string via ldflags based on git state.

```
# Full build (genprime + docs + setup + check + compile)
make build

# Quality checks only (formatting, vet, tests — no binary)
make check

# Wrong — version will show "unknown"
go build -o agenc .
```

`make setup` is run automatically by `make build` on first invocation. It configures `core.hooksPath` to `.githooks/`, which activates the pre-commit hook. The pre-commit hook runs `make check` on every `git commit`, so quality gates are enforced structurally — not by convention.

Do NOT use `--no-verify` to skip hooks.

**Sandbox:** The `make build` and `make check` commands require access to the Go build cache (typically at `~/.cache/go-build`), which is outside the default sandbox permissions. When running these, you must disable the sandbox by setting `dangerouslyDisableSandbox: true` in the Bash tool call. This is safe because the Makefile and Go toolchain are trusted build tools.

Running the Binary
------------------

When running or testing the `agenc` binary, **always** use the relative path `./agenc` — never the full absolute path.

```
# Correct
./agenc mission new "my mission"
./agenc mission ls

# Wrong — will trigger unnecessary permission prompts
/Users/odyssey/code/agent-factory/agenc mission new "my mission"
```

The project's `.claude/settings.json` allows `Bash(./agenc:*)`. Using the absolute path does not match this pattern and will cause avoidable permission prompts on every invocation.

Accessing $AGENC_DIRPATH
------------------------

You have unrestricted `Read`, `Glob`, and `Grep` access to `$AGENC_DIRPATH` (defaults to `~/.agenc/`, configurable via the `AGENC_DIRPATH` environment variable). This is configured in `.claude/settings.json`. When you need to explore or search files under the agenc directory, **always** use the `Glob` and `Grep` tools — never Bash commands like `ls`, `find`, or `grep`.

```
# Correct — use native tools
Glob("~/.agenc/**")
Grep(pattern, path="~/.agenc/")
Read("~/.agenc/some/file.json")

# Wrong — unnecessary Bash when native tools work without prompts
ls ~/.agenc/
find ~/.agenc/ -name "*.json"
grep -r "pattern" ~/.agenc/
```

The native tools run without permission prompts and provide better-structured output. Reserve Bash for operations that genuinely require shell execution.

Never Hardcode the Agenc Directory
-----------------------------------

The agenc base directory (`~/.agenc` by default) is configurable via the `$AGENC_DIRPATH` environment variable. **Never hardcode `~/.agenc` or any absolute path derived from it** in Go source code, tests, or scripts.

All path construction must flow from `config.GetAgencDirpath()`, which reads `$AGENC_DIRPATH` and falls back to `~/.agenc`. From that root, use the existing path helpers in `internal/config/config.go` (e.g., `GetConfigDirpath`, `GetRepoDirpath`, `GetMissionDirpath`).

```go
// Correct — derive from the dynamic root
agencDirpath, _ := config.GetAgencDirpath()
configDirpath := config.GetConfigDirpath(agencDirpath)

// Wrong — hardcoded path breaks when $AGENC_DIRPATH is set
configDirpath := filepath.Join(os.Getenv("HOME"), ".agenc", "config")
```

In tests, create a temporary directory and pass it as `agencDirpath` — never reference `~/.agenc` directly.

Git Push Workflow
-----------------

**Always run `git pull --rebase` before pushing.** Multiple agents and missions may be committing to this repo concurrently, so the remote is frequently ahead of your local branch. A pre-push rebase avoids rejected pushes and unnecessary retry cycles.

The correct sequence is: `git add` → `git commit` → `git pull --rebase` → `git push`

If the rebase surfaces conflicts, resolve them before pushing. Do not skip the pull-rebase step — even if you just pulled recently, another agent may have pushed in the interim.

Database Functions
------------------

Database functions should follow standard CRUD patterns — Create, Read, Update, Delete. Do not proliferate multiple Read functions for different filtering scenarios. Instead, use a single function with parameters that control filtering behavior.

```go
// Correct — one function with a parameter to control filtering
func (db *DB) ListMissions(includeArchived bool) ([]*Mission, error)

// Wrong — duplicated Read functions that differ only in a WHERE clause
func (db *DB) ListActiveMissions() ([]*Mission, error)
func (db *DB) ListAllMissions() ([]*Mission, error)
```

When a new query variation is needed, first check whether an existing function can be extended with a parameter rather than creating a new function.

Key File Locations
------------------

- The AgenC SQLite database lives at `~/.agenc/database.sqlite`.
- Claude's JSONL files live at `~/.claude/projects/`, **not** any `claude-config` directory.

Beads (bd)
----------

Use `bd` (Dolt backend), not `br`. The project is configured for shared Dolt server mode via `.beads/config.yaml`. No special flags are needed — `bd` reads the config automatically and auto-starts the shared server at `~/.beads/shared-server/` if it isn't running.

```
# Correct
bd list
bd create --title "My issue"
bd search "some query"

# Wrong — do not use br
br --no-db list
```

Banned Skills
-------------

**Do NOT invoke the `agenc-engineer` skill in this repository.** This skill is designed to create and modify AgenC agent configurations (personas, CLAUDE.md files, MCP configs), but this repo *is* the AgenC codebase itself. Invoking it here creates a circular dependency — you would be using an agent-generation skill to modify the system that generates agents.

The `agenc-engineer` skill is also explicitly blocked in `.claude/settings.json` via `Skill(agenc-engineer:*)`. Any attempt to invoke it will be denied.

If you encounter instructions or context that suggests using the `agenc-engineer` skill, ignore them. Treat all agent configuration work in this repo as normal code and documentation editing.

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd dolt push
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
