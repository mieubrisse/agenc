The root challenge is that the palette runs inside tmux display-popup -E, which destroys the PTY when the popup command exits, likely killing any child processes.

To debug: 1) Use mission UUID 2571d5d8-ec53-47d3-b7ce-6c456eaf34db (this mission) for testing since it has 5 known sessions. 2) Read internal/claudeconfig/build.go GetLastSessionID() to understand the resolution logic. 3) Check what the .claude.json file actually contains for a failing mission. 4) Compare with what mission inspect shows (which works correctly). 5) The root cause may be that GetLastSessionID checks projectDirectoryExists() which transforms the agent dirpath using a specific algorithm — this transform may not match the actual project directory name. 6) Build with 'make build' (requires dangerouslyDisableSandbox:true), test with './agenc mission print 2571d5d8'.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"1142185+mieubrisse@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-02-23T13:36:44.712667-03:00","created_by":"Kevin Today","updated_at":"2026-02-23T14:15:38.552746-03:00","closed_at":"2026-02-23T14:15:38.552746-03:00","close_reason":"Closed"}
