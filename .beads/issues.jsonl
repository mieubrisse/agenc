{"id":"agenc-n0e","title":"Mission-to-mission orchestration (sub-missions)","description":"Allow a running mission to spawn child missions as sub-workers — like Claude's Task tool but at the AgenC level. A parent mission creates a child mission with a prompt, the child runs as a live interactive Claude session in the tmux pool (not linked to any window), and the parent can optionally wait for the result or fire-and-forget. Key pieces: (1) a 'detached' creation path in spawnWrapper that calls createPoolWindow but skips linkPoolWindow and doesn't require TmuxSession, (2) parent-child relationship tracking, (3) a way to get results back (poll status + read output). Related: agenc-qoj (inter-agent chat) which would be useful for parent-child communication.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"1142185+mieubrisse@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-02-27T17:44:34Z","created_by":"Kevin Today","updated_at":"2026-02-27T17:44:34Z"}
