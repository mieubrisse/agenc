{"id":"agent-u33","title":"Refactor AI summarizer to use session scanner pipeline","description":"The mission summarizer currently scans JSONL files independently via ExtractRecentUserMessages() and writes ai_summary to the missions table. Refactor it to: (1) read conversation data from the sessions table populated by the session scanner instead of re-scanning JSONL files, (2) write its output to auto_summary on the active session in the sessions table instead of ai_summary on the missions table. This unifies the two summary sources (Claude's JSONL summaries and AgenC's Haiku-generated summaries) into a single per-session field, ensuring summaries survive session switches. After this refactoring, drop ai_summary from the missions table.","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","owner":"1142185+mieubrisse@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-02-27T19:51:49Z","created_by":"Kevin Today","updated_at":"2026-02-27T20:02:24Z","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"agent-u33","depends_on_id":"agent-1er","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-02-27T16:52:04Z","created_by":"Kevin Today","metadata":"{}"}]}
