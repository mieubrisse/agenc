- [ ] Implement better agent template organizational structure
- [ ] Add Bash aliases so you can `cd` to an agent's workdir
- [ ] Add tmux fanciness so that when opening a new pane from an existing agent session, it opens it in the MISSION_DIRPATH
- [ ] Add tmux fanciness: a popup window that allows jumping to anything (new repo, new agent, open a Git worktree on an existing project, whatever)
- [ ] Reload when global Claude config reloads
- [ ] Add `--no-separation` flag (or similar) so that when using Git worktrees, the repo's own agent can be used
    - This will check out the Git worktree in the `agent` directory
    - For now, disable the live-reloading logic (though can implement it later)
