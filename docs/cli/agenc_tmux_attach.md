## agenc tmux attach

Attach to the AgenC tmux session, creating it if needed

### Synopsis

Attach to the AgenC tmux session. If the session doesn't exist, it is
created with 'agenc mission new' as the initial command.

The session sets AGENC_TMUX=1 and propagates AGENC_DIRPATH so all windows
share the same agenc configuration.

```
agenc tmux attach [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for attach
```

### SEE ALSO
