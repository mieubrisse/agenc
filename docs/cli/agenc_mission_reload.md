## agenc mission reload

Reload one or more missions in-place (preserves tmux pane)

### Synopsis

Reload one or more missions in-place (preserves tmux pane).

Stops the mission wrapper and restarts it in the same tmux pane, preserving
window position, title, and conversation state. This is useful after updating
the mission config or upgrading the agenc binary.

Without arguments, opens an interactive fzf picker showing running missions.
With arguments, accepts a mission ID (short 8-char hex or full UUID).

For missions running in tmux, uses 'remain-on-exit' and 'respawn-pane' to
preserve the exact pane position. For missions not in tmux, falls back to
stop + resume workflow.

```
agenc mission reload [mission-id...] [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for reload
```
