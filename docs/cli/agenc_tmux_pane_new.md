## agenc tmux pane new

Create a new pane in the current window and run a command

### Synopsis

Create a new pane in the current tmux window by splitting it, and run a
command inside the new pane. When the command exits, the pane closes.

By default the new pane opens to the right. Use --below for a top/bottom
split. Use --detach to create the pane without switching focus to it.

The new pane inherits the current pane's working directory.

Must be run from inside the AgenC tmux session. Use -- to separate the
command from agenc flags.

Example:
  agenc tmux pane new -- agenc mission new mieubrisse/agenc
  agenc tmux pane new --below -- agenc mission new
  agenc tmux pane new --detach -- tail -f /tmp/log

```
agenc tmux pane new -- <command> [args...] [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -b, --below    Place the new pane below instead of to the right
  -d, --detach   Create the pane without switching focus to it
  -h, --help     help for new
```
