## agenc config init

Initialize agenc configuration (interactive)

### Synopsis

Initialize agenc configuration through an interactive wizard.

This command walks through all configuration steps that haven't been completed yet:

1. Config repo — if your config directory isn't backed by a git repo, prompts
   you to clone an existing agenc-config repo.
2. Claude config — if no Claude config source is registered, prompts you to
   register a repo containing your Claude configuration files.

The command is idempotent: steps that are already configured are skipped.


```
agenc config init [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for init
```
