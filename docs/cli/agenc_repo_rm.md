## agenc repo rm

Remove a repository from the repo library

### Synopsis

Remove one or more repositories from the repo library.

Deletes the cloned repo from $AGENC_DIRPATH/repos/ and removes it from the
repoConfig in config.yml if present.

When called without arguments, opens an interactive fzf picker.

Accepts any of these formats:
  repo                                 - shorthand (requires gh auth login)
  owner/repo                           - shorthand (e.g., mieubrisse/agenc)
  github.com/owner/repo                - canonical name
  https://github.com/owner/repo        - URL

Tip: Single-word shorthand works automatically if you're logged into gh (gh auth login)

```
agenc repo rm [repo...] [flags]
