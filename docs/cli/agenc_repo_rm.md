## agenc repo rm

Remove a repository from the repo library

### Synopsis

Remove one or more repositories from the repo library.

Deletes the cloned repo from $AGENC_DIRPATH/repos/ and removes it from the
repoConfig in config.yml if present.

When called without arguments, opens an interactive fzf picker.

Accepts any of these formats:
  owner/repo                           - shorthand (e.g., mieubrisse/agenc)
  github.com/owner/repo                - canonical name
  https://github.com/owner/repo        - URL

You can also use search terms to find a repo in your library:
  agenc repo rm my repo                - searches for repos matching "my repo"

```
agenc repo rm [repo...] [flags]
```
