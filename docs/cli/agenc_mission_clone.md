## agenc mission clone

Clone a mission with its conversation history

### Synopsis

Clone a mission with its conversation history.

Creates a new mission that is a full copy of the source mission's agent
directory and Claude conversation. The cloned mission inherits the same
Claude config snapshot as the source.

If the source mission is currently running, the clone waits for Claude to
reach an idle state before copying to ensure a consistent snapshot.
