## agenc tmux uninject

Remove AgenC tmux keybindings

### Synopsis

Remove the AgenC-managed keybindings source directive from your tmux.conf.
This removes the sentinel-wrapped block that sources the AgenC keybindings file.
The keybindings file itself remains in ~/.agenc/tmux/keybindings.conf but will
no longer be sourced by tmux.

If a tmux server is running when you uninject, you may need to restart it or
manually unbind the keys for the changes to take full effect.

```
agenc tmux uninject [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for uninject
```

### SEE ALSO
