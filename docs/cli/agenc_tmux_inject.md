## agenc tmux inject

Install AgenC tmux keybindings

### Synopsis

Write an AgenC-managed keybindings file and add a source-file directive to
your tmux.conf. If a tmux server is running, the keybindings are sourced
immediately.

All keybindings live under the "agenc" key table, activated with prefix + a:
  prefix + a, M  — new mission in a new tmux window
  prefix + a, P  — new mission in a side-by-side pane

```

```
