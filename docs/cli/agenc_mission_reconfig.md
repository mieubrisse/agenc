## agenc mission reconfig

Apply your latest ~/.claude config to a mission

### Synopsis

Apply your latest ~/.claude config to a mission.

Each mission gets a snapshot of your ~/.claude configuration (CLAUDE.md,
settings.json, skills, hooks, etc.) at creation time. When you change
~/.claude, existing missions keep their old config until you reconfig them.

This command rebuilds a mission's config directory from your current
~/.claude state. Running missions must be restarted to pick up the changes.

Use 'agenc mission ls -a' to see which missions are behind and by how many commits.
Use --all to reconfig all non-archived missions at once.

```
agenc mission reconfig [mission-id] [flags]
```

### Options

```
      --all    reconfig all non-archived missions
  -h, --help   help for reconfig
```
