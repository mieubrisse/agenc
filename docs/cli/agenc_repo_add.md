## agenc repo add

Add a repository to the repo library

### Synopsis

Add a repository to the repo library by cloning it into $AGENC_DIRPATH/repos/.

Accepts any of these formats:
  owner/repo                           - shorthand (e.g., mieubrisse/agenc)
  github.com/owner/repo                - canonical name
  https://github.com/owner/repo        - HTTPS URL
  git@github.com:owner/repo.git        - SSH URL
  /path/to/local/clone                 - local filesystem path

You can also use search terms to find an existing repo in your library:
  agenc repo add my repo               - searches for repos matching "my repo"

For shorthand formats, the clone protocol (SSH vs HTTPS) is auto-detected
from existing repos in your library. If no repos exist, you'll be prompted
to choose.

Use --sync to keep the repo continuously synced by the daemon.

```
agenc repo add <repo> [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for add
      --sync   keep this repo continuously synced by the daemon
```
