## agenc cron run

Manually trigger a cron job (runs headless, untracked by cron_id)

### Synopsis

Manually trigger a cron job to run immediately as a headless mission.

The mission will NOT be tracked as a cron run (no cron_id/cron_name will be set).
This is useful for testing cron jobs without affecting history/scheduling.

Example:
  agenc cron run daily-report
  agenc cron run daily-report --timeout 30m


```
agenc cron run <name> [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help             help for run
      --timeout string   override timeout (e.g., '1h', '30m')
```
